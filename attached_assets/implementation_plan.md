# Implementation Plan for Cabo San Lucas Travel Booking Platform

This implementation plan is organized into five phases: Environment Setup, Frontend Development, Backend Development, Integration, and Deployment. Each step is a single action with file paths and document references to ensure clarity and traceability.

## Phase 1: Environment Setup

1.  **Install Node.js and NPM:**

    *   Check if Node.js is installed; if not, install Node.js (latest LTS version) along with NPM.
    *   **Reference:** PRD Section 1

2.  **Set Up Git Repository:**

    *   Initialize a Git repository and create `main` and `dev` branches with branch protection rules.
    *   **Reference:** PRD Section 1

3.  **Create Project Directory Structure:**

    *   Create project root with subfolders: `/frontend`, `/backend`, and `/infra`.
    *   **Reference:** PRD Section 1

4.  **Set Up PostgreSQL Database:**

    *   Launch a PostgreSQL container (PostgreSQL 15.3) using Docker.
    *   Command example:

    `docker run --name cabosanl_db -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=yourpassword -d postgres:15.3`

    *   **Reference:** PRD Section 2 (CRM and Booking Data)

## Phase 2: Frontend Development

1.  **Initialize React Application:**

    *   In the `/frontend` directory, initialize a new React application using Create React App.
    *   Command:

    `npx create-react-app .`

    *   **Reference:** Tech Stack Document (react)

2.  **Organize Frontend Folder Structure:**

    *   Create directories: `/frontend/src/components`, `/frontend/src/pages`, and `/frontend/src/services`.
    *   **Reference:** Frontend Guidelines Document

3.  **Develop Home Page Component:**

    *   Create `/frontend/src/pages/Home.js` featuring high-quality images, and sections for best resorts, featured adventures, and top restaurants.
    *   **Reference:** PRD Section 3 (User Flow)

4.  **Create Booking Page Components:**

    *   Develop two distinct page components:

        *   `/frontend/src/pages/BookingForm.js` for form fill pages (villas, bachelorette, luxury concierge).
        *   `/frontend/src/pages/BookingBuyNow.js` for direct booking pages (resorts, adventures, yachts, airport transportation).

    *   **Reference:** PRD Section 3 (Booking Process)

5.  **Integrate Social Proof and FAQs:**

    *   In each booking page, add sections for social proof, FAQs, images, and descriptions.
    *   **Reference:** PRD Section 3 (Landing Pages Details)

6.  **Set Up Routing with React Router:**

    *   Modify `/frontend/src/App.js` to include routes for Home, BookingForm, BookingBuyNow, Admin Login, and Business Partner Login.
    *   **Reference:** PRD Section 3 (User Flow)

7.  **Implement Mobile-Responsive Design:**

    *   Use CSS media queries and a mobile-first approach (e.g., flexbox and Grid) to ensure optimal display on iPhones and other mobile devices.
    *   **Reference:** PRD Section 6 (Mobile Optimization)

## Phase 3: Backend Development

1.  **Initialize Node.js with Express:**

    *   In the `/backend` directory, initialize a new Node.js project and install Express.
    *   Command:

    `npm init -y npm install express`

    *   **Reference:** Tech Stack Document (node_js, express)

2.  **Set Up Backend Folder Structure:**

    *   Create subdirectories in `/backend`: `/routes`, `/controllers`, `/models`, and `/services`.
    *   **Reference:** Backend Structure Document

3.  **Create Booking API Endpoint:**

    *   Create `/backend/routes/bookings.js` with a POST endpoint `/api/book` to handle booking requests.
    *   **Reference:** PRD Section 2 (Booking Platform)

4.  **Implement Authentication Endpoints:**

    *   Create `/backend/routes/auth.js` to manage user logins for admin, business partners, and travelers using JWT and Passport.js.
    *   **Reference:** PRD Section 2 (User Roles & Logins) and Tech Stack Document (jwt, passport_js)

5.  **Develop Payment Processing Routes:**

    *   Create `/backend/routes/payments.js` and integrate payment gateways (Stripe, PayPal, and Apple Pay) to handle transactions.
    *   **Reference:** PRD Section 2 (Payment Processor Integration) and Tech Stack Document (stripe, paypal, apple_pay)

6.  **Integrate CRM Functionality:**

    *   Create `/backend/routes/crm.js` and a corresponding model at `/backend/models/customer.js` to capture and manage customer data (name, email, phone, booking history).
    *   **Reference:** PRD Section 2 (CRM Integration)

7.  **Implement Google Calendar Integration:**

    *   Develop a service file `/backend/services/googleCalendar.js` to sync with a master Google Calendar for local events updates.
    *   **Reference:** PRD Section 2 (External Calendar Integration)

## Phase 4: Integration

1.  **Connect Frontend to Booking API:**

    *   In `/frontend/src/services/api.js`, implement API calls using axios to connect booking pages (both form fill and buy now) with the backend `/api/book` endpoint.
    *   **Reference:** App Flow Document (User Flow) and PRD Section 3

2.  **Configure CORS Policy in Backend:**

    *   Update `/backend/app.js` (or main server file) to configure CORS and allow frontend requests (e.g., from `http://localhost:3000`).
    *   **Reference:** Tech Stack Document (Security)

3.  **Validate API Endpoints:**

    *   Use Postman or curl to test endpoints (e.g., POST `/api/book`, `/api/auth/login`) ensuring correct responses.
    *   **Validation:** Run tests and verify status 200 responses.
    *   **Reference:** PRD Section 2 (Booking Platform, Authentication)

## Phase 5: Deployment

1.  **Deploy Frontend to AWS S3:**

    *   Build the React application (`npm run build`) and deploy the static assets to an AWS S3 bucket in the `us-east-1` region.
    *   Create deployment config file at `/infra/aws/s3-deploy.yaml`.
    *   **Reference:** PRD Section 7 (Cloud & Storage) and Tech Stack Document (aws_s3)

2.  **Set Up CI/CD Pipeline:**

    *   Configure a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., using GitHub Actions) to automate testing and deployment for both the frontend and backend.
    *   **Validation:** Verify that pipeline runs tests and deploys on merge to the main branch.
    *   **Reference:** Developer Tools (Cursor, Replit) for collaboration

This plan follows the specified project requirements with clear, step-by-step actions, including file paths, references to the PRD, tech stack, and guidelines necessary to build and deploy the Cabo San Lucas travel platform.
