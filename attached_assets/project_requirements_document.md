# Project Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Project Overview

This project is all about building a one-stop travel platform focused on Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. It’s designed to bring together the best resorts, hotels, villas, adventures, travel guides, bachelorette tips, luxury concierge services, and local events in one visually captivating website. The idea is to provide travelers with an experience similar to TripAdvisor or Booking.com, but with a dedicated focus on the unique experiences available in Cabo. This project will support both immediate bookings and lead generation via form fills, depending on the service type.

The platform is being built primarily to serve travelers looking for curated and high-quality travel experiences while also giving local businesses a dedicated space to manage their listings and bookings. The key objectives are to offer a smooth, image-focused user journey, seamless payment processing, and easy-to-use management interfaces for both administrators and business partners. Success will be measured by user engagement, ease of booking, quick loading times (especially on mobile devices), and accurate, real-time information on local events and offerings.

## 2. In-Scope vs. Out-of-Scope

### In-Scope

*   **Booking Platform**: A complete system that allows users to book resorts, hotels, villas, and adventures with calls to action either to “Buy Now” or to fill out a form, based on the service.

*   **CRM Integration**: A CRM system to capture and manage customer data including names, emails, phone numbers, and booking history. It will support segmentation for targeted marketing (email, SMS, WhatsApp).

*   **User Roles & Logins**:

    *   **Admin Login**: Full access to system management, listings, and booking oversight.
    *   **Business Partner Login**: Restricted access for managing their own listings, uploading/changing images and descriptions, and viewing booking analytics.

*   **Payment Processor Integration**: Integration with major payment gateways such as Stripe, PayPal, and Apple Pay supporting multiple currencies (USD, CAD, MXN) with refund capabilities.

*   **Landing Pages**: Different landing pages with high-quality images, social proof, FAQs, and differing calls-to-action (form fill for villas, bachelorette, luxury concierge vs. buy now for resorts, adventures, yachts, airport transportation).

*   **Mobile Optimization**: A fully mobile-optimized experience to cater to social media-driven traffic, especially from iPhone users.

*   **External Calendar Integration**: Synchronization with a master Google Calendar for real-time local events and activities updates.

### Out-of-Scope

*   **Advanced Search Functionality**: Instead of traditional search, the focus is on category-based navigation.
*   **Customization of Payment Workflows Beyond Basic Refunds**: While refunds are supported, advanced refund processes or dispute management will be considered in later phases.
*   **Complex Third-Party API Integrations**: Beyond integration with Stripe, PayPal, Apple Pay, and Google Calendar, additional external services or property management systems are not in the initial phase.
*   **Extensive Social Media Integration**: Social media driven traffic is expected, but deep integrations (like posting directly to feeds or in-app social features) are not planned for phase one.

## 3. User Flow

A typical traveler will land on the visually captivating home page, much like popular travel sites such as Airbnb, Booking.com, or TripAdvisor. The landing page prominently showcases high-quality images of Cabo San Lucas with featured sections like best resorts, top restaurants, and unique adventures. The user does not need to perform a traditional search; instead, they simply click on the category that interests them. Once they click on a category, they are taken to a detailed page that emphasizes imagery, social proof, FAQs, and a clear call-to-action.

Depending on the type of service selected, the call-to-action will either prompt the traveler to immediately book (through a “Buy Now” button for adventures, resorts, yachts, and airport transportation) or to fill out a detailed form (for villas, bachelorette events, or luxury concierge services). After interacting with these pages, if the service is booked, the platform processes the payment securely through integrated payment gateways. Simultaneously, the traveler’s booking information is captured in the integrated CRM, allowing for streamlined follow-ups and personalized future communications.

## 4. Core Features (Bullet Points)

*   **Comprehensive Booking Experience**:

    *   Visually appealing landing pages showcasing featured resorts, adventures, and restaurants.

## 5. Tech Stack & Tools

*   **Frontend**:

    *   React for building interactive, component-based user interfaces.
    *   Likely use of modern CSS frameworks or styled components to ensure a visually engaging and mobile-responsive design.

*   **Backend**:

    *   Node.js with Express to create the server-side logic and API endpoints.
    *   PostgreSQL for managing relational data like bookings, customer information, and listings.

*   **Cloud & Storage**:

    *   AWS S3 for storing and delivering images and other static assets.

*   **Authentication & Security**:

    *   JWT (JSON Web Tokens) and Passport.js for secure user authentication and role-based access control.

    *   Stripe, PayPal, and Apple Pay for payment processing.
    *   Google Calendar API for syncing event information.

*   **Developer Tools**:

    *   Cursor for advanced IDE features and AI-powered coding support.
    *   Replit for collaborative coding and quick prototyping.

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

*   **Performance**:

    *   Fast page load times, especially for mobile devices.
    *   Quick response times for booking transactions and data retrieval.

*   **Security**:

    *   Use industry-standard encryption and secure authentication mechanisms (JWT, Passport.js) to protect user data.
    *   Regular security audits and adherence to compliance standards for financial transactions.

*   **Usability**:

    *   A minimal, image-first design to facilitate easy navigation.
    *   Mobile optimization is critical, ensuring seamless interactions across all device sizes.

*   **Scalability**:

    *   Architecture should allow for future expansion of features or increased traffic without a major overhaul.

## 7. Constraints & Assumptions

*   The platform will rely on the availability of third-party services such as Stripe, PayPal, Apple Pay, and Google Calendar.
*   Assumes that most traffic is mobile-first, particularly from social media referrals and iPhone users.
*   The scope of advanced search and deep social media integrations are assumed to be unnecessary for phase one.
*   Performance targets include minimal load times even when handling high-quality images and real-time event updates.

## 8. Known Issues & Potential Pitfalls

*   **API Rate Limits**: There might be limitations on the number of API calls allowed by third-party services like Google Calendar, Stripe, and PayPal. A caching mechanism or rate limit monitoring should be considered.
*   **Mobile Performance Challenges**: High-resolution images can affect load times on mobile devices. This issue can be mitigated by image optimization and use of a Content Delivery Network (CDN) such as AWS CloudFront.
*   **Security Risks**: As the platform handles payment processing and personal data, ensuring robust security measures is critical. Regular audits and updates will help mitigate risks.
*   **Role-Based Access Complexities**: With different login levels for admin and business partners, ensuring that permissions are robust and bug-free is vital to prevent data leaks or unauthorized changes.
*   **Dependency on Third-Party Services**: The overall functionality is dependent on the stable availability and performance of third-party APIs (payment processors, calendar sync). Contingency plans should be assembled in case these services experience downtime.
*   **User Experience Balance**: While an image-focused design is key, ensuring that there is enough textual information to engage users without overwhelming them is a fine balance that will need careful UI/UX testing.
