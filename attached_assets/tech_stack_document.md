# Tech Stack Document

## Introduction

This project is a dedicated travel and booking platform focused on Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, designed to bring together the best resorts, hotels, villas, adventures, travel guides, bachelorette tips, luxury concierge services, and local events in one visually captivating website. The goal is to provide travelers with a seamless, image-driven experience, while also giving local businesses access to a management interface for updating their listings and monitoring booking analytics. The technology choices made here are driven by the need for high performance, scalability, and a user-friendly experience across both desktop and mobile devices.

## Frontend Technologies

For the frontend, we have chosen React as the primary framework. React allows us to build an interactive and responsive user interface with a component-driven approach, much like modern travel sites such as Airbnb and Booking.com. Modern CSS methodologies and possibly styled components will be used to create a minimalistic, image-first design that is both visually appealing and optimized for mobile use. This ensures that users can easily navigate through large images and categories without being overwhelmed by text, making the booking journey intuitive and enjoyable.

## Backend Technologies

The backbone of our application is powered by Node.js along with the Express framework. This combination ensures that our server is capable of handling numerous API calls, managing dynamic content, and providing a robust set of functionalities for the booking platform. PostgreSQL is used as the relational database to manage key data such as customer profiles, booking histories, and business partner listings. Additionally, we have implemented JWT and Passport.js to secure user authentication, ensuring that both traveler and partner data remains confidential and accessible only to authorized users.

## Infrastructure and Deployment

The project is designed with scalability and reliability in mind. Cloud-based services such as AWS S3 have been integrated to store and deliver high-quality images and other static assets quickly and efficiently. For version control and collaborative development, we have integrated modern IDE tools like Cursor and Replit, which provide advanced real-time suggestions and collaborative coding features. This setup not only streamlines the deployment process but also ensures that continuous integration (CI) and deployment (CD) pipelines run smoothly, making it easier to update the system with new features and maintain high uptime.

## Third-Party Integrations

A range of third-party services has been integrated to enhance the overall functionality of the project. Payment processing is handled through integrations with Stripe, PayPal, and Apple Pay, enabling transactions in multiple currencies such as USD, CAD, and MXN. This multi-gateway approach ensures a seamless, secure, and versatile payment experience for users. In addition, the application integrates with the Google Calendar API to synchronize a master event calendar, which automatically updates local events and activities. This integration keeps event information current without requiring manual updates, ensuring that users always have access to the latest happenings in Cabo San Lucas.

## Security and Performance Considerations

The technology stack incorporates robust security measures to protect sensitive data and ensure safe transactions. Authentication is managed using JWT and Passport.js, which together provide a secure framework for role-based access controls, including separate logins for admins and business partners. Performance has been a critical consideration, with optimizations such as image compression and the use of AWS S3 for rapid asset delivery ensuring that page loads are swift and the user experience remains uninterrupted, especially on mobile devices. These measures collectively contribute to a platform that maintains both high security and an optimal performance profile even during peak usage.

## Conclusion and Overall Tech Stack Summary

In summary, the chosen technology stack is carefully tailored to meet the specific needs of a Cabo San Lucas travel and booking platform. The frontend powered by React offers a clean and responsive interface, while the backend built on Node.js with Express and PostgreSQL provides a robust framework for data management and user authentication. Cloud storage through AWS S3, combined with intelligent developer tools like Cursor and Replit, ensures a smooth development and deployment process. Additionally, the integrations with major payment processors and Google Calendar enhance the platform’s functionality by providing secure transactions and real-time event updates. The combined choices in this tech stack not only align well with the project’s overall goals but also set the stage for a reliable, scalable, and user-friendly application that stands out in the competitive travel booking market.
