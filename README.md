2. Create a new scenario with a "Webhook" trigger as the first module
3. Copy the webhook URL provided by Make.com
4. Run the setup script: `./setup_make_webhook.sh` and follow the prompts
5. In Make.com, set up the data mapping from the webhook to Airtable or other services
6. Turn on your scenario to start receiving data

### Setting Up Zapier Integration

1. Create a Zapier account at [https://www.zapier.com](https://www.zapier.com)
