# Replit Workflow Solution Guide

## Current Changes Implemented

We've made several improvements to address the client-side rendering issues:

1. **Enhanced Client Wrapper Component:**
   - Created a more robust client-wrapper with proper error handling
   - Implemented dynamic imports with `{ ssr: false }` for all components with browser-specific code
   - Added proper loading and error states to provide better UX

2. **Removed Type Errors in Components:**
   - Fixed social-share component button size props to use valid values
   - Addressed known type issues that were being flagged by TypeScript

3. **Added Safe Navigation Component:**
   - Created a new `SafeNavigation` utility component that wraps Wouter's Link
   - Ensures navigation only happens after component is mounted in the browser
   - Prevents SSR issues related to window/location references

## Loading Issues & Solutions

The main issue affecting the loading of the application was related to browser/window references during server-side rendering. This was causing hydration mismatches and errors that prevented the app from fully loading.

Our solution implements the following pattern:

1. Dynamic imports with `ssr: false` for components with browser code
2. Client-side only rendering for sections that need browser APIs
3. Safe conditional rendering with mounted state checks
4. Error boundaries to gracefully handle failures

## Next Steps for Complete Website Functionality

1. **Implement throughout other components:**
   - Replace standard `Link` components with `SafeNavigation` where needed
   - Ensure any code using `window` is only executed after component mount

2. **Optimize First Load Experience:**
   - Add skeleton loaders where appropriate
   - Pre-load critical data to reduce content shifting

3. **Debug Remaining Issues:**
   - Use the browser console to identify and fix any remaining errors
   - Address type errors in the home-page component related to Villa data

## Usage Instructions

When creating new components or modifying existing ones:

1. **For components that use browser APIs:**
   ```tsx
   // Use the useEffect + isMounted pattern
   const [isMounted, setIsMounted] = useState(false);
   
   useEffect(() => {
     setIsMounted(true);
   }, []);
   
   // Only access window/browser APIs after mount
   useEffect(() => {
     if (isMounted) {
       // Safe to use window, navigator, etc.
     }
   }, [isMounted]);
   ```

2. **For navigation links:**
   ```tsx
   // Import the safe navigation component
   import { SafeNavigation } from '@/components/safe-navigation';
   
   // Use instead of direct Link
   <SafeNavigation to="/path">
     Link Text
   </SafeNavigation>
   ```

3. **For dynamic imports:**
   ```tsx
   // Import with ssr: false for browser-dependent components
   const BrowserComponent = dynamic(() => import('./path'), { 
     ssr: false,
     loading: () => <LoadingPlaceholder />
   });
   ```

By following these patterns, we can ensure the application loads reliably in the Replit environment while maintaining all functionality.
