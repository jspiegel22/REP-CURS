# Neon to Supabase Migration: Complete

## Migration Status: âœ… Success

The migration of the database from Neon PostgreSQL to Supabase has been completed successfully. All database tables have been verified to exist in Supabase.

## Tables Successfully Migrated

1. guide_submissions
2. users
3. villas
4. resorts
5. bookings
6. leads
7. listings
8. rewards
9. session
10. social_shares

## Environment Configuration

The application is now configured to use Supabase as the primary database. The following environment variables are in use:

- `SUPABASE_URL` - The URL to your Supabase project
- `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` - The anonymous key for your Supabase project
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` - The service role key for your Supabase project (for admin operations)
- `DATABASE_URL` - The direct PostgreSQL connection string to your Supabase database

## Running the Application

The application has been configured to work with Replit's environment:

1. The standard port for Next.js is 3000, but Replit requires port 5000 for detection and integration.
2. To solve this, a proxy server has been set up to forward requests from port 5000 to port 3000.
3. The application can be started using the `./run.sh` script, which starts both the Next.js server and the proxy.

## Additional Files Created

- `port-5000.js` - The proxy server that forwards requests from port 5000 to port 3000
- `start-combined-servers.js` - Script to start both the Next.js server and the proxy
- `run.sh` - The main entry point script that runs the application
- `check-supabase-tables.js` - A utility script to verify that all tables exist in Supabase

## Technical Details

### Database Access

The application uses the Supabase JavaScript client for most database operations. For more complex operations, the direct PostgreSQL connection is used.

```javascript
// Using Supabase client
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from('guide_submissions')
  .select('*');

// Using direct PostgreSQL connection (for complex operations)
const result = await db.query('SELECT * FROM guide_submissions');
```

### Connection Pooling

Supabase uses connection pooling to manage database connections efficiently. This means:

1. The application doesn't need to worry about connection limits
2. Connections are automatically closed when not in use
3. Peak performance can be achieved without manual connection management

## Next Steps

1. Begin implementing new features using the Supabase platform
2. Consider migrating authentication to use Supabase Auth
3. Take advantage of Supabase's built-in features:
   - Real-time subscriptions
   - Edge Functions
   - Storage Buckets
   - GraphQL Interface
