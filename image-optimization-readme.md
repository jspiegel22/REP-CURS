# Image Optimization for Cabo San Lucas Travel Website

This document details the image optimization strategy implemented for the website to improve performance.

## Image Optimization Steps

### 1. Image Compression

All JPEG images on the website have been compressed with the following characteristics:
- Quality level: 80% (maintains visual quality while reducing file size)
- Compression algorithm: mozjpeg (provides better compression than standard JPEG)
- Overall size reduction: **77.71%** from original file sizes

### 2. WebP Conversion

All images have been converted to the WebP format:
- Quality level: 80% (maintains high visual quality)
- Overall size reduction: **83.75%** from original file sizes
- WebP provides better compression than JPEG while maintaining visual quality
- Supported by all modern browsers

### 3. Image Reference Updates

The `imageMap.ts` file has been updated to:
- Reference WebP images instead of JPGs
- Use appropriate fallback images where needed
- Provide utility functions for handling different image formats

### 4. Performance Benefits

- Faster page load times
- Reduced bandwidth usage
- Better mobile experience
- Improved Core Web Vitals metrics

## Image Organization

Images are organized in the following structure:
- `/public/images/{category}/{image-name}.webp`

Where categories include:
- testimonials
- hero
- villas
- resorts
- restaurants
- activities
- beaches
- weddings
- yachts
- luxury
- family
- blog

## Future Improvements

Possible future enhancements for image optimization:
1. Implement responsive images with multiple sizes using the `srcset` attribute
2. Add lazy loading for images below the fold
3. Implement a comprehensive image CDN strategy
4. Add automatic WebP detection with JPG fallbacks for older browsers

## Tools Used

The optimization was performed using:
- Sharp library for Node.js (image processing)
- Custom script `image-optimizer.js` for batch processing
