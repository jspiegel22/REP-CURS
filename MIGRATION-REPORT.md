# Supabase Migration Report

## Overview
This document details the migration from Neon PostgreSQL to Supabase as the primary database for the Cabo travel platform. The migration was completed on April 5, 2025.

## Migration Steps Completed

### 1. Schema Migration
- Successfully created all necessary tables in Supabase:
  - `users` - User accounts and authentication 
  - `guide_submissions` - Travel guide download requests
  - `listings` - Generic listings for various categories
  - `villas` - Villa rental properties
  - `resorts` - Resort properties
  - `adventures` - Adventure and excursion activities
  - `bookings` - Customer bookings
  - `leads` - Sales and inquiry leads
  - `weather_cache` - Weather data caching
  - `session` - User session data for authentication
  - `rewards` - Customer loyalty rewards
  - `social_shares` - Social media sharing tracking

### 2. Data Migration
Successfully migrated data from the following tables:
- `adventures`: 13 records
- `guide_submissions`: 10 records
- `leads`: 3 records
- `resorts`: 100 records
- `users`: 1 record
- `weather_cache`: 1 record

The following tables were empty in the source database and required no data migration:
- `bookings`
- `listings`
- `rewards`
- `session`
- `social_shares`
- `villas`

### 3. Environment Configuration
- Fixed swapped Supabase environment variables:
  - `REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL` contained the API key
  - `REACT_APP_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` contained the URL
- Updated the `.env` file to enable Supabase as the primary database
- Validated the connection to Supabase

### 4. Application Integration
- Updated the storage implementation to use Supabase
- Implemented port forwarding for Replit compatibility (Next.js runs on port 3000, Replit expects port 5000)
- Created utility scripts for:
  - Migration verification
  - Port proxy for Replit

## Verification
Performed verification of the migration with:
1. Database connection test
2. Table structure verification 
3. Record count validation
4. Application integration test

## Next Steps
1. Monitor application performance with Supabase
2. Update any remaining code references to the previous database
3. Remove deprecated migration scripts and utilities
4. Consider implementing more Supabase-specific features (auth, realtime, storage)
