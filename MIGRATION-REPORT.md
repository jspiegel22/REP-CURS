### Instructions to Complete Migration in Supabase

To finalize the migration, please:

1. **Push migration files to GitHub**  
   Connect your Supabase project to your GitHub repository where these migration files are stored. Supabase will automatically detect and run the files in `supabase/migrations/`.

2. **Run seed data manually**  
   After the schema is created:
   - Go to Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor
   - Open the file `supabase/seed/2025_04_05_seed_data.sql` from your repository
   - Copy the contents and paste into the SQL Editor
   - Click "Run" to import all data

3. **Verify migration success**  
   - Go to Supabase Dashboard → Table Editor
   - Confirm all 12 tables are present with correct structure
   - Sample a few records to ensure data integrity
   - If needed, run a query to count rows in each table to verify complete data transfer

### Environment Variables
The `.env` file has been updated to use Supabase as the default database connection:
```
USE_SUPABASE=true
DATABASE_URL=[Your Supabase Postgres URL]
```

### Migration Verification
- Schema verified: All tables from Neon are now structured in Supabase migration files
- Data prepared: All data from Neon exported and ready for import to Supabase

## Next Steps
Once GitHub integration is set up with Supabase and the data is imported, the migration will be 100% complete. Your application should then seamlessly connect to Supabase instead of Neon.
