                REPLIT WORKFLOW UPDATE GUIDE
===============================================================

Replit expects applications to run on port 5000, but Next.js defaults to 
port 3000, causing workflow failures with:

  "didn't open port \`5000\` after 20000ms"

To fix this:

1. Go to the "Tools" menu in Replit
2. Select "Workflows"
3. Edit the "Start application" workflow
4. Replace the current command "npm run dev" with:
   
   node replit-entry.js
   
5. Save the workflow
6. Run the workflow

The replit-entry.js script:
- Opens port 5000 immediately with a proxy
- Automatically detects which port Next.js is using
- Forwards all requests properly

After updating, verify by navigating to /health-check in your browser
