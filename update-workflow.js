==========================================================================================
IMPORTANT: Please update your Replit workflow manually by following these steps:
==========================================================================================

1. Go to the "▶ Run" button at the top of the Replit interface
2. Click on the gear icon (⚙️) next to the Run button
3. In the "Commands" section, find "Start application" 
4. Change the command from "npm run dev" to "node replit-entry.js"
5. Click "Done" to save your changes
6. Click the "▶ Run" button to restart your application

This will ensure your app runs correctly on Replit by:
- Properly handling port forwarding from port 5000 (Replit's expected port) to port 3000 (Next.js)
- Ensuring your app is visible in the web preview
- Allowing both the frontend and API to function correctly
