# Replit Workflow Solution

If you're having issues with the webview not displaying your app correctly in Replit, follow these steps to fix it:

## Option 1: Use replit-direct.js (Recommended)

1. Open the **Shell** tab in Replit
2. Stop any running processes with `Ctrl+C`
3. Run the direct proxy script:
   ```
   node replit-direct.js
   ```
4. Wait a moment for Next.js to start up
5. Your app will be available immediately on port 5000

## Option 2: Update Replit Workflow (Permanent Solution)

1. Click on the **Tools** menu in the top navigation bar
2. Select **Workflows**
3. Find the "Start application" workflow
4. Edit the workflow task that runs the script
5. Replace:
   ```
   node replit-entry.js
   ```
   With:
   ```
   node replit-direct.js
   ```
6. Add a "wait_for_port" property with value 5000
7. Save your changes
8. Restart the workflow by clicking the "Run" button

## Option 3: Add a new workflow

1. Click on the **Tools** menu 
2. Select **Workflows**
3. Create a new workflow named "Reliable Server"
4. Add a shell.exec task with:
   ```
   node replit-direct.js
   ```
5. Add wait_for_port: 5000
6. Save and run this workflow

## Troubleshooting

If you're still having issues:

1. Run `node monitor-app.js` to check if your ports and services are working correctly
2. Try opening your app in a new browser tab rather than using the webview
3. Check the console logs for any errors
