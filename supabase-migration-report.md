# Supabase Migration Report

## Overview
This report documents the migration of our PostgreSQL database to Supabase. It includes details about the migration process, encountered issues, and solutions implemented.

## Migration Status
- **Database Migration Status**: Complete
- **Tables Migrated**: 11 tables (users, listings, resorts, bookings, leads, guide_submissions, rewards, social_shares, weather_cache, villas, adventures)
- **Data Migration**: Complete
- **Schema Updates**: Applied

## Database Connection
- **PostgreSQL Connection**: Working via DATABASE_URL
- **Supabase Connection**: Working via SUPABASE_URL and SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
- **Current Database**: Configurable via USE_SUPABASE environment variable (true/false)

## Migration Steps
1. **Schema Migration**
   - Exported schema from PostgreSQL using pg_dump
   - Created SQL migration files in supabase/migrations/
   - Applied schema to Supabase using exec_sql function

2. **Data Migration**
   - Exported data from PostgreSQL tables
   - Formatted and transformed data as needed
   - Imported to Supabase in batches
   - Verified data integrity after import

3. **Application Updates**
   - Added SupabaseStorage implementation of IStorage
   - Updated storage.ts to support both PostgreSQL and Supabase
   - Application can switch between databases using USE_SUPABASE flag

## Migration Tools
- **exec_sql Function**: Created in Supabase to allow executing raw SQL
- **Migration Scripts**:
  - migrate-to-supabase.sh - Main migration script
  - scripts/create_exec_sql_function.js - Creates required function in Supabase
  - scripts/direct-migrate-to-supabase.js - Direct migration logic
  - check-supabase-tables.js - Verifies table existence
  - enable-supabase.js - Enables Supabase in the application

## Known Issues and Solutions
1. **exec_sql Function**
   - Issue: Supabase restricts raw SQL execution by default
   - Solution: Created a custom Postgres function with proper security definer
   - Notes: Must be created manually in Supabase SQL Editor before migration

2. **Connection String Format**
   - Issue: Supabase connection strings differ from standard PostgreSQL
   - Solution: Created separate connection handlers for each database type
   - Notes: Application determines which to use based on USE_SUPABASE flag

3. **Data Type Differences**
   - Issue: Some JSON fields require different handling in Supabase
   - Solution: Added data transformation in processRows function
   - Notes: Arrays, JSON objects, and dates required special handling

## Verification
- Database connectivity verified using check-supabase-tables.js
- Table structure verified against original schema
- Data integrity verified through count and sample comparisons
- Application functionality tested with both database options

## Rollback Plan
If issues are encountered with Supabase:
1. Set USE_SUPABASE=false in .env
2. Restart the application
3. Application will revert to PostgreSQL database

## Conclusion
The migration to Supabase has been successfully implemented. The application can now operate with either database backend, allowing for a smooth transition and fallback option if needed. We recommend enabling Supabase permanently after a testing period of 1-2 weeks with no issues reported.
