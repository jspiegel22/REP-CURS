- **Integrity Verification**: Process implemented to ensure data accuracy

## Tables to Migrate

| Table Name | Purpose | Status |
|------------|---------|--------|
| users | User accounts and authentication | Ready for migration |
| listings | Property and service listings | Ready for migration |
| resorts | Resort information and details | Ready for migration |
| villas | Villa information and TrackHS integration | Ready for migration |
| bookings | Booking records and reservation details | Ready for migration |
| adventures | Adventure activities and experiences | Ready for migration |
| leads | Lead generation form submissions | Ready for migration |
| guide_submissions | Travel guide download requests | Ready for migration | 
| rewards | User reward and loyalty information | Ready for migration |
| social_shares | Social media sharing records | Ready for migration |
| weather_cache | Cached weather data for locations | Ready for migration |
| session | User session data for authentication | Ready for migration |

## Migration Process

The migration follows these steps:

1. **Validate Field Compatibility**
   - Compare PostgreSQL schema with Airtable specifications
   - Ensure data types and field names are compatible

2. **Generate SQL Migration Files**
   - Create table definitions and indexes
   - Prepare SQL functions for Supabase compatibility

3. **Create Custom SQL Execution Function**
   - Add `exec_sql` function to Supabase for advanced operations
   - Configure appropriate security policies

4. **Migrate Schema**
   - Create tables, indexes, and relations in Supabase
   - Ensure data integrity constraints are maintained

5. **Migrate Data**
   - Transfer data from PostgreSQL to Supabase
   - Process and transform data as needed

6. **Verify Data Integrity**
   - Compare record counts between systems
   - Validate successful migration of all records

7. **Enable Supabase in Application**
   - Update configuration to use Supabase
   - Implement conditional database storage selection

## Implementation Details

### Code Adaptations

The application implements a dual-storage approach allowing seamless transition:

```typescript
// Example from server/storage.ts
export const storage = isSupabaseConfigured() && process.env.USE_SUPABASE === 'true'
  ? new SupabaseStorage()
  : new DatabaseStorage();
```

This approach ensures zero downtime during migration as both systems can operate in parallel.

### Validation Scripts

The validation scripts ensure compatibility between Airtable fields and database schema:

- `scripts/validate-airtable-fields.js`: Checks field compatibility
- `scripts/verify-migration-integrity.js`: Verifies data integrity after migration
- `check-supabase-tables.js`: Confirms table creation in Supabase

### Service Worker Integration

The application's offline capabilities have been enhanced with PWA features:

- Service worker registration in `client/src/main.tsx`
- Offline page in `client/public/offline.html`
- Guide form submission handling with offline support
- IndexedDB storage for offline form submissions

## Post-Migration Requirements

1. **Update Environment Configuration**
   - Set `USE_SUPABASE=true` after successful migration
   - Maintain both PostgreSQL and Supabase connections temporarily

2. **Application Testing**
   - Test all form submissions with Supabase storage
   - Verify data retrieval and display functions
   - Confirm offline capabilities

3. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Monitor Supabase query performance
   - Optimize indexes if needed
   - Implement additional caching as required

4. **Airtable Synchronization**
   - Verify bi-directional synchronization with Supabase
   - Update Airtable integration services

## Known Issues and Considerations

1. **TrackHS Integration**
   - Current TrackHS integration relies on direct PostgreSQL queries
   - Adapt TrackHS data synchronization to use Supabase RPC calls

2. **Session Management**
   - Ensure `connect-pg-simple` session store works with Supabase
   - Consider alternative session storage solutions if needed

3. **Database Indexes**
   - Some custom indexes may need to be recreated in Supabase
   - Review query performance after migration

4. **RLS Policies**
   - Implement appropriate Row Level Security policies in Supabase
   - Configure secure access patterns

## Conclusion

The migration to Supabase offers several advantages:

- **Improved Scalability**: Supabase's built-in scaling capabilities
- **Reduced Maintenance**: Managed database service with automatic updates
- **Enhanced Security**: Row-level security and built-in authentication
- **Realtime Capabilities**: Potential for realtime updates and subscriptions
- **Reduced Costs**: Elimination of separate database hosting fees

The migration scripts and processes have been prepared with careful attention to data integrity and validation against existing Airtable specifications. The implementation of a dual-storage approach ensures minimal disruption during the transition phase.
